# The 8-Week SQL Challenge
This repository holds response solutions to the #8WeekSQLChallenge created by [Data with Danny](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/).

I engaged in these case study challenges as a way to exhibit my proficiency in a range of SQL techniques and demonstrate my skill in applying SQL to diverse scenarios. 
This was also an opportunity to use PostgreSQL, which I was not previously familier with, but am now more than comfortable working in.
